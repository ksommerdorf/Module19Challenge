## Results

* Data Porcessing
  * The target for this model is 
  * The features of this model are
  * Variables that are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data
* Compiling, Training, and Evaulating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural newtork model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
