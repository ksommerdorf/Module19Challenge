## Overview of Project

## Results
Data Processing
 * The target for this model: IS_SUCCESSFUL which provides if the money used effectively with a value of '1' for yes and '0' for no. 
 * The features of this model: 
   * APPLICATION_TYPE - Alphabet Soup application type
   * AFFILIATION - Affiliated sector of industry
   * CLASSIFICATION - Government organization classification
   * USE_CASE - Use case for funding
   * ORGANIZATION - Organization type
   * STATUS - Active status
   * INCOME_AMT - Funding amount requested
   * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS - Special consideration for application (removed during Optimization)
   * ASK_AMT - Funding amount requested
 * Variables that are neither targets nor features and were removed from the input data:
   * EIN and NAME - Identification columns
   * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS (removed during Optimization)
  
Compiling, Training, and Evaulating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural newtork model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
